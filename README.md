## 🌟 About Me

I have always been passionate about computers! I successfully completed an intensive course as a Java back-end developer, where I gained a solid foundation and feel confident in my skills. I am proficient in working with the Spring framework and familiar with application architecture, including REST APIs. I am committed to continuous improvement, attending classes and updating my knowledge regularly. Although I am still refining my teamwork skills, I am motivated to grow in this area and become a collaborative and effective team member.
